# Syllog
Educational Quiz on Syllogistic Logic. With logging.

## What is this?

This is Syllog, an educational tool to teach University students about
syllogistic logic.

Syllog is part of an ongoing research project on improving teaching methods in logic.

Students can use the web front end for improving their skills in
recognizing the validity or invalidity of Aristotelian syllogisms.

Syllog also features a logging back end. Whenever someone (a student,
for example) uses the front end tool, question and answer activity is
logged anonymously.

We have used this for a number of years to test the abilities of
students before, during, and after a course in basic logic. We have
then used this and other feedback in an attempt to improve the course
for the following year's students.
