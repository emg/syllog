  <h1>A note about Syllog</h1>

<h2>What is this?</h2>

<p>This is Syllog, an educational tool to teach University students
about syllogistic logic.</p>

<p>Syllog is part of an ongoing research project on improving teaching
methods in logic.</p>

<p>Students can use the web front end for improving their skills in
recognizing the validity or invalidity of Aristotelian syllogisms.</p>

<p>Syllog also features a logging back end. Whenever someone (a
student, for example) uses the front end tool, question and answer
activity is logged anonymously.</p>

<p>We have used this for a number of years to test the abilities of
students before, during, and after a course in basic logic. We have
then used this and other feedback in an attempt to improve the course
for the following year's students.</p>

<h2>Collaborators</h2>
